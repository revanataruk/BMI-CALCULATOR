## ⚙️ How BMI is Calculated
The application uses the standard BMI formula:
```
BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))²
```

BMI Categories:
- Below 18.5: Skinny
- 18.5 to 24.9: Normal
- 25 to 29.9: Fat
- 30 and above: Obesity

Body Fat Percentage is estimated using the following formulas:
- For men: (1.20 × BMI) + (0.23 × Age) - 16.2
- For women: (1.20 × BMI) + (0.23 × Age) - 5.4
